<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of rxivist_exploration is to explore the abstract views and pdf download statistics of *bioRxiv* preprints, as collected by the [rxivist](https://rxivist.org/) project (github:  [https://github.com/blekhmanlab/rxivist/](https://github.com/blekhmanlab/rxivist/))

# File description

* `paper_stats.RDS` is a binary RDS file with computed data statistics
* `raw_stats.RDS` is a binary RDS file with the raw download and view data
* `paper_stats.Rmd` is the Rmarkdown containing stats and graphs and analyses
* `paper_stats.md` is the rendered markdown output (see that first!!)

Remaining files are the RStudio project and git repo miscellany files.
