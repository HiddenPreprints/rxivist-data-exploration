<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of rxivist\_exploration is to explore the abstract views and
pdf download statistics of *bioRxiv* preprints, as collected by the
[rxivist](https://rxivist.org/) project (github:
<https://github.com/blekhmanlab/rxivist/>)

# File description

  - `paper_stats.RDS` is a binary RDS file with computed data statistics
  - `raw_stats.RDS` is a binary RDS file with the raw download and view
    data
  - `paper_stats.Rmd` is the Rmarkdown containing stats and graphs and
    analyses
  - `paper_stats.md` is the rendered markdown output (see that
    first\!\!)

Remaining files are the RStudio project and git repo miscellany files.
